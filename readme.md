This is a simple tool developed in Node, which places words which are an anagram of one another on the same line in a text file.

To use the tool, in comand line, enter the same folder as the `sortAnagram.js` file and run: 

`node sortAnagram.js filename.txt`

the output is returned into a seperate file called `output.txt`
